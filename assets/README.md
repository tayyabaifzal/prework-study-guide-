# <Prework Study Guide Webpage
>

## Description

This guideline will enable new students to kickstart bootcamp, equipping them with basic knowledge, terminalologies and framework of web development. We built a study guideline website to practice git, html, css and js.This really helped understanding the course and what to look forward to. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


## Installation

 n/a

## Usage

Each section contains information about topics such as GIT, HTML, CSS. DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
 
## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
